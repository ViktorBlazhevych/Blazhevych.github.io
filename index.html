        <h2>1. Scope, provider</h2>
        1.1 The Terms and Conditions of Use apply to the use of the online dating app “MARRY ME” (in the following: the “App”), irrespective of where it is used. By registering, you (the “User”) acknowledge that you have read, understood and accepted the Terms and Conditions of Use. The contractual language is German, except where it is specified otherwise or the Terms and Conditions of Use are presented in another language.<br>
        1.2 You can download and print out the Terms and Conditions of Use on the MARRY ME website (<a href = "https://go-marryme.com">www.go-marryme.com</a>) at any time. Alternative provisions that contradict these Terms and Conditions of Use, especially the user’s terms and conditions, do not apply.<br>
        1.3 The provider of the App is MARRY ME Group AG, Gotthardstrasse 26, CH-6300 Zug (in the following: "MARRY ME").
        <p></p>   
        <h2>2. Amendment of the Terms and Conditions of Use and the service</h2>
        2.1 MARRY ME is entitled at any time to amend these Terms and Conditions of Use. MARRY ME will notify you of any amendments in good time, at least four weeks in advance. Where you do not object to the amendments within two weeks of notification, your acceptance of the amendments will be assumed. You will be informed once more of this arrangement in the notification of amendments. For the event that you object to the amendments, MARRY ME reserves the right to cancel your use of the App.<br>
        2.2 MARRY ME is entitled to change the service when necessary for good cause, provided you are not placed at an objective disadvantage by this change and there are no materially substantive alterations of the service. Good cause in this regard shall apply to changes of the service to accommodate technical developments, changes in the upstream services provided by third parties that MARRY ME requires for the performance of its service, or when statutory provisions or court decisions necessitate a restriction or expansion of the service. In changing its service, MARRY ME is entitled to limit the scope of content that you are permitted to upload.
        <p></p>
        <h2>3. Service</h2>
        3.1 MARRY ME provides its service as an online dating App to flirt, chat and meet people that is available on mobile apps for iOS and Android devices and that will be compatible with other smartphone platforms in future as well.<br>
        3.2 You receive access to a database that enables users to meet and establish romantic relationships and friendships. The database contains profiles with photographs of and information about other users. Registered users are able to access these profiles and information and make contact with other users. For a detailed description of the individual functions offered within the MARRY ME service, kindly refer to the menu item Settings in the FAQ. It is stated explicitly that MARRY ME is not a matrimonial agency service.<br>
        3.3 The service is provided for personal purposes only. Commercial use is strictly prohibited, especially for the purposes of showing advertising to other users or collecting data about other users.
        <p></p>
        <h2>4. Registration and login</h2>
        4.1 Use of the App requires that you complete the registration process, in which you must select a name and a password as well provide your email address as necessary information for use of the service. This data is stored in your profile. You are not required to provide your real name and are entitled to choose a pseudonym (username). Once registration is complete, you will receive an email confirming your free registration; you are not entitled to conclusion of a contract. MARRY ME reserves the right to reject applications for registration at its own equitable discretion and without stating reasons.<br>
        4.2 The data you provide during registration should be complete and truthful. Only you are authorised to use the profile. You are not permitted to grant third parties access to your account.<br>
        4.3 You can also sign in using Facebook or Google+. If you do so, MARRY ME is entitled to access certain account information, including your public profile data. Signing in using this login procedure is equivalent to registration.<br>
        4.4 You are required to keep your login details secret – especially your password – and to refrain from disclosing them to third parties; you must store the login details in such a way that they cannot be accessed by third parties. You are advised to change your passwords regularly. To do so, select the menu item “Settings → My Account”. You must notify MARRY ME immediately by email (<a href = "mailto:contact@go-marryme.com">contact@go-marryme.com</a>) if you lose your login details or become aware of unauthorised access; MARRY ME shall in that case be entitled to block your profile in order to prevent abuse.<br>
        4.5 You must be at least 18 years old. MARRY ME is entitled to insist that you submit proof of your age in justified individual cases.
            <p></p>
            <h2>5. Scope of services</h2>
            5.1 As a registered user, you will have free access to the App functions, in particular the display of data that may be retrieved by other users, e.g. images and profile data. You will also be able to make contact with other users by sending them electronic messages in the App and meet these users in case of mutual interest. Visit the MARRY ME FAQs for a detailed description of the functions. MARRY ME reserves the right to restrict the frequency with which the functions are used.<br>
            5.2 MARRY ME makes every effort to improve its services and to offer you additional functions. Nevertheless, continued development of the App means that the content and scope of the functions can be changed, restricted, expanded or discontinued at any time.
            5.3 MARRY ME does not owe any success, rather only the provision of technical services to enable users to make contact via the App. MARRY ME cannot influence whether and which contacts you establish with other users.<br>
            5.4 The contractual text is not saved automatically when the contract is concluded. You are therefore advised to save or otherwise archive the contractual text applicable (and accessible) at the time of contract conclusion.<br>
            5.5 The App may contain advertisements and promotions from third parties that are organised by these third parties and that may contain links to other websites. MARRY ME is not responsible for the availability or content of these external websites, as MARRY ME is not the provider. Any interactions between you and these services shall be on your own responsibility and based on the terms and conditions of the respective provider.
            <p></p>
            <h2>6. Cancellation policy </h2>
            6.1 Cancellation right<br>
            You have the right to cancel this contract within fourteen days without providing reasons. The cancellation period is fourteen days from conclusion of the contract.<br>
            To exercise your right of cancellation, you must inform us (MARRY ME Group AG, Gotthardstrasse 26, CH-6300 Zug, Switzerland, contact@go-marryme.com) by sending an unequivocal statement (e.g. by post, telefax or email) of your decision to cancel this contract. You may use the enclosed Cancellation Statement template, although it is not mandatory.<br>
            Your timely dispatch of your intention to cancel the contract before the end of the cancellation period shall be deemed sufficient for compliance with the cancellation period.<br>
            Consequences of cancellation
            <p></p>
            If you cancel this contract, we will return all payments we have received from you, including the delivery costs (with the exception of additional costs incurred through selection by you of a method of delivery that is more expensive than the standard delivery method offered by us), without undue delay and no later than fourteen days after the date on which we received notification of your decision to cancel this contract. We will use the same method of payment for this refund that you used for the original transaction, unless otherwise agreed explicitly with you; on no accounts will you be charged fees for this refund.<br>
            The cancellation right does not apply to a contract for the provision of services if the company has provided the services in full and did not begin with the performance of services until the consumer gave explicit consent in full knowledge that the right of cancellation would lapse upon complete fulfilment of the service by the company.<br>
            Moreover, the cancellation right does not apply to a contract for the provision of digital content not located on a physical storage medium if the company has begun with the performance of the contract with the explicit consent of the consumer that the company should begin with the performance of the contract before the end of the cancellation period and the consumer has confirmed awareness that the right of cancellation would lapse with the start of the contractual performance.<br>
            6.2 Cancellation Statement template Kindly fill out the following form and send it back to us if you wish to cancel the contract.<br><br>

            <h2>7. Availability </h2>
            7.1 MARRY ME is entitled to adapt, discontinue or otherwise change the services at any time, provided the user can be reasonably expected to accept the change or deviation, with due consideration of the interests of MARRY ME.<br>
            7.2 Users do not have a right to permanent, trouble-free access and uninterrupted use or availability. This applies in particular when access is impaired by a malfunction that is not the responsibility of MARRY ME. There may be temporary and/or content restrictions in the availability of the services or individual features for technical reasons (e.g. maintenance). Temporary interruptions in service due to routine maintenance, disruptions affecting external providers or network operators, as well as incidents of force majeure are possible at any time.
            <p></p>
            <h2>8. Term and cancellation </h2>
            8.1 You are entitled at any time to delete your profile without providing reasons and in doing so to cancel the contract of use with MARRY ME. You may delete your profile using a function in the App (“Settings → My Account → Delete Account”), in writing or by email. Each deletion shall be considered an immediate termination of registration. When you delete your account, all of your personal data will also be irretrievably deleted, except where it is required for compelling reasons (e.g. legal reasons). You must manage your in-App purchases separately via your mobile device platform (e.g. iTunes, Google Play); MARRY ME has no influence on this.<br>
            8.2 MARRY ME may terminate your profile with immediate effect if you violate the Terms and Conditions of Use.

            <p></p>
            <h2>11. Costs and terms of payment</h2>

            14.2 By internal arrangement, you hold MARRY ME completely harmless of all claims arising from infringements associated with the use of your content, including reasonable costs of legal defence.

This is without prejudice to the statutory provisions of the country in which you have your habitual place of residence, which cannot be derogated from by agreement.<br>

            <h2>1. Preface, miscellaneous, data security </h2>
            You disclose personal data when using an online dating app. Some of this data (e.g. username, photos, profile information) is shown to other users of the app. MARRY ME is aware of its special responsibility associated with the processing of this data. MARRY ME uses state-of-the-art technology and recognised security standards to guarantee suitable technical measures that protect your data to the greatest possible extent. MARRY ME implements organisational measures involving strict controls, clear policies and terms of use in order to guarantee that processing of your data by employees and third parties (e.g. service providers or other users) takes place in compliance with statutory requirements. MARRY ME takes questions of data protection very seriously. You can send us questions and feedback at any time by email or by post (<a href = "mailto:contact@go-marryme.com">contact@go-marryme.com</a>). MARRY ME will make every effort to answer as promptly as possible. When processing personal data, MARRY ME adheres at all times to the applicable rules of data protection. Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. All data that you transfer to MARRY ME will be treated confidentially. Subject to the subsections below, your data will not be made available for use by third parties, except where you have provided consent or MARRY ME is entitled or obliged to do so (e.g. by court order). External service providers acting in the name and on behalf of MARRY ME do not count as third parties. They include payment services providers, collection agencies or email and newsletter distributors. MARRY ME points out explicitly that the data disclosed by you in your profile was made available voluntarily to other users on the app. MARRY ME uses suitable technical and organisational security measures to protect your data from coincidental or intentional manipulation, partial or complete loss, destruction or unauthorised access by third parties. The security measures are improved continuously in line with developments in technology. MARRY ME uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential information that you send to MARRY ME (the website operator), for instance contact requests. You can tell that the connection is encrypted if the address line of your browser switches to "https://" and a padlock symbol is shown in the browser line. Third parties will be unable to read the data that you send to us if SSL or TLS encryption is enabled.

            The personal data collected by MARRY ME for the use of the contact form will be erased automatically once the enquiry you placed has been dealt with.
            
            <h3>d) When using the app</h3>
            
            In order to provide the App services, it is necessary to process personal data that you disclose during the registration process, in the App (e.g. when answering the personality questions or in your profile) or when making in-app purchases. The data is collected for the performance of the contract between MARRY ME and you. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 paragraph 1 points (a+b) GDPR.<br>
            In this regard, MARRY ME collects your personal data, including sensitive data, where it is provided voluntarily by you. You enter data during the registration process (first name, last name, email address, password) for the purpose of using the MARRY ME services. In order to improve use of the matching functions, i.e. to recommend users more suitable to you and to make better use of the other app functions, it is necessary that you provide additional data, for instance on your preferences, personal values, tastes, appearance and other qualities that are relevant in your search for a partner. This information is requested in the personality questionnaire. Specifically, you can:
            <ul>
                <li>Upload photos of you;</li>
                <li>Describe yourself in the "About me" field;</li>
                <li>Provide information about your job, place of residence, appearance (height, figure) and your interests;</li>
                <li>Answer intimate questions about your preferences (e.g. whether you would like to have children or the importance of sexuality);</li>
                <li>Define search settings, namely whether you are looking to meet men or women, your preferred age group, geographical radius or other search filters;</li>
                <li>Enable push notifications (i.e. allow MARRY ME to send push notifications to your mobile device).</li>
            </ul>
            
            The provision of this data, which you enter and edit in your user profile, is voluntary. It is not necessary to enter this data to use the app; however, it may not be possible to use all the app functions if you do not provide this information.<br>
            When you log in with your Facebook or Google+ profile, you allow MARRY ME to access certain information, for instance your public profile, your email address, interests, likes, gender, date of birth, education, location and photos, etc.<br>
            The information you make available is used exclusively for the provision of the app services. Most of the data is used exclusively for internal purposes at MARRY ME to optimise the services we provide to you (e.g. to recommend matches or to improve your chances in the Matching Game). Some of this data is disclosed to other users, namely your profile data that is shown to other users (name, pictures, "About me" information, job, interests, looking for, appearance, online status).<br>
            This data is only shown in the app and exclusively to other registered users. The data is not accessible from outside the app.

            <p></p>
            <h2>4. Disclosure of data</h2>
            Your personal data will not be transferred to third parties, except for the purposes listed in the following. MARRY ME only transfers your personal data to third parties where:
            <ul>
                <li>you have issued your explicit consent according to Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 point (a) GDPR;</li>
                <li>transfer takes place according to Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 point (f) GDPR for the protection of the legitimate interests, in particular for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims and where there is no reason to assume that you have an overriding legitimate interest in non-disclosure of your data;</li>
                <li>transfer takes place for compliance with a legal obligation according to Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 point (c) GDPR; and</li>
                <li>it is lawful and necessary for the performance of the contractual relationship with you according to Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 point (b) GDPR.</li>
            </ul>
            Within the app, the data is transferred to other users insofar as they are able to view the data in your profile (refer to Section 3 subsection (d) above). Where users access the app from outside the European Union or the European Economic Area, it is therefore possible that your data will be transferred to a third country. MARRY ME is neither able to guarantee that nor to influence whether the respective country maintains an adequate level of data protection. You are hereby explicitly notified of the risks associated with this process. In this regard, the transfer of data is necessary for the performance of the contract with you (Art. 49 paragraph 1 point (b) GDPR).<br>
            You also consent to the transfer by registering on the app (Art. 49 paragraph 1 point (a) GDPR).<br>
            We seek to protect the transfer procedure and your rights as best we can through the application of our strict quality standards, monitoring of adherence to our Terms and Conditions of Use and our technical security measures.

            <span class="PBold">Adjust</span>
            MARRY ME uses the app analysis service Adjust (adjust GmbH, Saarbrücker Str. 38a, 10405 Berlin) in order to analyse use of the app. The Adjust service has been tested and certified according to the ePrivacyseal (European Seal for your Privacy) (<a title="https://www.eprivacy.eu/kunden/vergebene-siegel/#seal2" href="https://www.eprivacy.eu/kunden/vergebene-siegel/#seal2">https://www.eprivacy.eu/kunden/vergebene-siegel/#seal2</a>). To perform its analyses, Adjust uses the IP and MAC addresses of the app users, but only after anonymisation. It is therefore not possible to draw any conclusions about a natural person. The information collected by Adjust is only used to analyse the functions and use of the app by producing anonymised evaluations and graphs on the number of visits, the number of page views per visitor and suchlike. The analyses are used exclusively for the purposes of internal market research, as well as for the optimisation and needs-based design of the app. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 paragraph 1 point (f) GDPR. MARRY ME has a legitimate interest in analysing user behaviour to optimise both its website and its advertising.<br><br>
            <span class="PBold">Google Analytics Remarketing</span>
            Our website uses the features of Google Analytics Remarketing combined with the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and DoubleClick. This service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.<br>
            This feature allows you to link the advertising target groups generated with Google Analytics Re-marketing to the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. In this way, interest-based, personalised advertising messages, which have been customised based on your previous usage and browsing behaviour on one device (e.g. your mobile phone), may also be dis-played on other devices (such as your tablet or computer).<br>
            Once you have given your consent, Google will associate your web and app browsing history with your Google account for this purpose. That way, any device that signs in to your Google account can use the same personalised promotional messaging.<br>
            To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users that are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion.<br>
            You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by disabling personalised advertising in your Google account; to do so, click on the following link: <a title="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/" href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a><br>
            The aggregation of the collected data in your Google account is based solely on your consent, which you can give or revoke on the Google website (Art. 6 paragraph 1 point (a) GDPR). For data collection operations that are not merged into your Google account (e.g. because you do not have a Google account or have objected to the merge), the collection of the data is based on Art. 6 paragraph 1 point (f) GDPR. MARRY ME has a legitimate interest in the anonymised analysis of website traffic for advertising purposes.<br>
            For further information and Google's data privacy regulations, refer to the Google privacy policy: <a title="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/" href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/">https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/</a>.<br><br>
            <span class="PBold">Google AdWords and Google Conversion-Tracking</span>
            This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States (“Google”).<br>
            As part of Google AdWords, we use so-called conversion tracking. When you click on an ad served by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is placed on your device. Cookies are small text files that your Internet browser places on your computer. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification of the user. If the user visits certain pages of the website and the cookie has not yet expired, we and Google can see that the user clicked on the ad and was directed to this page.<br>
            Each Google AdWords advertiser has a different cookie. Thus, cookies cannot be tracked using the website of an AdWords advertiser. The information obtained with the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for the AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. Customers learn the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a website with a conversion tracking tag. However, advertisers do not obtain any information that can be used to personally identify users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can opt out of this by disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie in your browser's user settings. By doing so, you will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.<br>
            Storage of conversion cookies takes place pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1 point (f) GDPR. MARRY ME has a legitimate interest in analysing user behaviour to optimise both its website and its advertising.<br>
            For more information about Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking, refer to the Google privacy policy: <a title="https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/" href="https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/</a>.<br><br>
            <span class="PBold">Facebook Pixel</span>
            Our website measures conversions using visitor action pixels from Facebook, Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”).<br>
            This allows tracking of the website visitor's behaviour once they have clicked on a Facebook ad and are redirected to the MARRY ME website. This enables analysis of the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes and their future optimisation.<br>
            The data collected is anonymous to us as operators of this website and we cannot use it to draw any conclusions about our users' identities. However, the data is stored and processed by Facebook, which may make a connection to your Facebook profile and use the data for its own promotional purposes, as stipulated in the Facebook privacy policy. This will allow Facebook to display ads both on Facebook and on third-party sites. As site operators, we have no control over how this data is used. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 paragraph 1 point (f) GDPR.<br>
            Refer to the Facebook data policy for information on how to protect your privacy: <a title="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a><br>
